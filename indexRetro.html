          Hi there! If you're reading this, you're probably part of ZTM and got curious about what another student might have created using just pure HTML5... well, good on ya! I didnâ€™t check anything beforehand, so I'm going rogue here.
          Anyhow... I did browse through W3Schools for more tags like <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> and attributes like <code>style</code> and <code>font-size</code>, but it's mostly the same basic stuff.
        </p>

        <p style="color: #EEEEEE; font-size: 1.2em;">
          So, what is this really? I took the opportunity to make a website like the ones I remember from my childhood in the 90s with a few tweaks. Those early websites were wild! Donâ€™t believe me? Here, have a look (at your own risk): 
          <a style="color: #F79B72;" href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/exhibitions/antonio-banderas-1995">Old Website</a> (yeah, I know...).
          <br><br>
          Anyway, I donâ€™t think they were built quite the way Iâ€™m doing it now, but weâ€™re going for the vibe. The frontend is pure HTML... how do I know? Well, I went through the *very* extensive research process of typing into Google: "what tags did they use in the 90s for pure HTML websites." And there you go! ðŸ˜„ 
          Also, there's something called the "Wayback Machine" for inspiration.
          <br><br>
          So... did it take me almost a whole day to build this? Yes. Was this part of any assignment or task? Nope. Will it make you a better web developer? I donâ€™t think so! Was any of this necessary? Not at all!! But hey, I had fun, alright? 
          I might need to go outside more...
          <br><br>
          But for now, letâ€™s enjoy those 90s-style webpages.
        </p>

        <p style="color: #EEEEEE; font-size: 1.2em;">
          Enough of me rambling. Weâ€™re here for the games, right???
        </p>

        <p style="color: #EEEEEE; font-size: 1.2em;">
          So here are some 90s game reviews.

    Hey... why only these consoles and games???
  </p>

  <p style="color: #EEEEEE;">
    Well, I wasnâ€™t lucky (or rich) enough to own every console and game... anyhow, long live emulation! Now I can play them allâ€”<i>*cough* just need the time to do it *cough*</i>. These are the ones I actually owned at some point. Iâ€™ve picked only one game per console to keep things simple I donâ€™t want this turning into a massive project (though hey, it might become a fun little side quest).
    <br><br>
    If you want to recommend a console or game, hit me up on Discord! Iâ€™ll happily check it out and definitely add it after Iâ€™ve had a go.
